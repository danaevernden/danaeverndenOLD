<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<strong>What's the deal with you?</strong><br>
I am in the infancy of starting an automation consulting business.
I do not know how it will shake out. For right now I am offering <i>FREE</i> services
in exchange for reviews and publicity. I have seen organizations struggle through data
mining and repeated processes without the aid of Excel formulas and macros, and I'm
here to help remedy those situations and replace those processes with faster, streamlined processes.
<br><br><strong>Why you?</strong><br>
Why me? Why not! I have been formally automating processes for the past three
years and am only seeing my passions growing. I love the idea of empowering
employees to work on only the most meaningful tasks, with those repeatable tasks
left to be dealt with by those things we stare at all day. If I meet an organization
 that is in need of something I cannot offer, I'll do whatever I can to mold my talents
 to fit their needs.
 <br><br><strong>What are you offering?</strong><br>
This is TBD for now. As I do not know what organizations are in need of, I do not
have a concrete idea of what to offer. I am thinking along the lines of preparing a
short curriculum on Excel formulas and VBA macros, and assisting in building out
a process for an organization that can be used as an example for optimizing
other processes across the organization. I'd also like to have conversations around
task scheduling and prioritization, organizational culture, examining the organization's priorities from a bird's eye view,
and exploring the 'someday' to-do list.

<br><br><strong>OK, I'm interested. Where do we start?</strong><br>
Head over to the <a href="/contact">contact page</a> and shoot me a message. Thanks for your interest!
